## Features

- **ShortRangeRadar**: Detects players within a 100m radius with high precision. Ideal for close-range monitoring and tactical gameplay.
- **LongDistanceRadar**: Detects players beyond 300m with a larger detection error. Useful for broader area surveillance.
- **Portable Jammer**: Applies the "jammered" effect to the user, making them undetectable by radars and preventing the detection of others.
- **Nametag Disabling**: Disables the rendering of player nametags, preventing visibility through walls and enhancing stealth gameplay.
