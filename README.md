- **LongDistanceRadar**: Detects players beyond 300m with a larger detection error. Useful for broader area surveillance.
- **Portable Jammer**: Applies the "jammered" effect to the user, making them undetectable by radars and preventing the detection of others.
- **Nametag Disabling**: Disables the rendering of player nametags, preventing visibility through walls and enhancing stealth gameplay.
